    <h3>About Me</h3>
    </div>
      <div class="accordion-content">
    <p>I was born and partly raised in Cardiff and moved to Dubai for the later years of secondary school. I then moved back to the UK for university, unfortunately covid hit in the third year of university and I moved back to Dubai for the remaining of the covid pandemic. 
    </p>
    <p>I’m currently based in London, I moved her for my first role post-uni where I worked as an SDR a tech start-up (this is where I got introduced to the tech industry). I’m quite outgoing and love interacting with new people, so I decided to transition to a more client-facing role which led me to my current role as an Influencer Relations Specialist.</p></div></div>

  <div class="accordion-container" id="career"><div class="accordion-header"><h3>Why do I want to move into a career as a developer</h3></div>
    <div class="accordion-content">
      <p>My first job after university was at a tech start-up, even though I was in a non-tech role, working in the industry was still very exciting. During my time at the company, I was able to shadow developers as well as the product team and seeing how they were at the heart of our product and how much they spend working on improvements and advancements was really inspiring. I wanted to be more involved so that’s how I began researching into roles and attending tech events.</p>
      <p>
        During my research, I discovered that there was a lack of representation when it came to women in tech and I did notice it within my company. To learn more about the community, I attended a women in tech conference where I got to hear the stories of so many women, as well las be amongst a community that’s working on increasing the diversity within the tech industry. This experience motivated me in many ways, I thought it was too late for me to go into a coding position since I didn’t study any related subjects in school or university, but these women encouraged me to start learning and that any age wasn’t too late. </p>
      <p>So I began my journey and that’s what led me to Founders and Coders. Of course, the main goal is to become a developer, but I do want to also learn in order to encourage other women and minority groups to close the gap in the tech industry.</p></div></div>
